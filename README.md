    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The Login &amp; Signup Form project has two main pages: a login page and a
      signup page.
    </p>
    <h3>Login Page</h3>
    <p>
      The login page allows existing users to log in to their account. It
      features two input fields, one for the user's email and the other for
      their password. Once the user submits their credentials, the form will
      validate their inputs and check whether the user's email and password are
      correct. If the credentials are valid, the user will be redirected to the
      home page. If the credentials are invalid, an error message will be
      displayed.
    </p>
    <h3>Signup Page</h3>
    <p>
      The signup page allows new users to create an account. It features input
      fields for the user's name, email, password, and confirmation password.
      Once the user submits their information, the form will validate their
      inputs and check whether the email is available. If the email is already
      in use, an error message will be displayed. If the email is available and
      the passwords match, the user's account will be created, and they will be
      redirected to the login page.
